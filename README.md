Skira is still in active development. We are working towards a final release ASAP (1.0.0) and will then keep the API stable.

## Usage

Open a command window and run `skira` in your project directory.

## Contributing

We recommend installing the ESLint and JSCS plugins into your editor to instantly check your code against the guidelines. This will make pull requests easier for everyone.
